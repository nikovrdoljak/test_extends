# test_extends
Created for testing github pages issue with extends keyword in markup.
1. First, lets change README.md and check if [github page](https://nikovrdoljak.github.io/test_extends/) is updated after commit and push.
2. As expected, page is built. Now I will add some HTML code:

```html
<h3>Header</h3>
<p>Paragraph</p>
```

3. I will add this in code above: _{% extends 'admin/master.html' %}_
